# Graph Agent

`gragent` is a Graph Agent which uses a dynamic config graph to drive its
execution. It should not be confused with `gragent`, which is sometimes what
people call Grafana Agent. If you find the names confusing, use this helpful
tip: `gragent` is Graph Agent, while `gragent` is Grafana Agent!

Graph Agent is an expressions prototype of [Grafana Agent
Flow](https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/1546).
